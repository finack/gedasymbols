# The Library
Here be my personal gEDA suite symbols and footprints.

## SPDT switch
*This part is in beta. Meaning, I have not gone to production with this and
verified that it works*

A cute little bugger that I purchase from [Sparkfun](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9609).
To use, add the built-in gschem symbol switch-spdt-1.sym to your diagram and set
the footprint to "spdt\_slide\_switch".

# Related Information
More footprints can be fount at [gEDA Symbols](www.gedasymbols.org). These
objects were created following this sage advice:

* [gschem symbol creation](http://www.geda.seul.org/wiki/geda:gschem_symbol_creation)
* [master attributes list](http://www.geda.seul.org/wiki/geda:master_attributes_list)

No fish were hurt in the making of these objects.
